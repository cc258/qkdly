			the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on
			over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that
			belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow
			the Wolf in the Sheepâ€™s clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he
			soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the
			sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.
